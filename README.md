# SSProject

This project was created for the Nueva Software Studio class fall semester taught by Wes Chao.

First, set up an SSH key on your local device
```
ssh-keygen
```

Second, clone the repository locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:KansterMonster/SSProject.git
```

NOTE: 18.2 vs 18.1 react dependency is weird
